# CS F469 Assignment 3

### For running code - 
- Download the movielens dataset (1M) from [Kaggle](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/)
- Extract the dataset zip
- Run `Code.ipynb` code entirely once before running any file. This will generate the item-similarity matrix which is to be used later.
- Run `Collaborative_filtering.ipynb`, `SVD.ipynb`, `CUR.ipynb` before running `metrics.ipynb`
- Pickled Files are initially git ignored (so you will have to run all of the files at least once)
- Run `metrics.ipynb` after all of the prediction matrices are pickled
